**Today's Progress**: Started learing React Native, and finished with all the setup.

**Thoughts:** Currently i use React.js for web development and i wanted to learn also mobile develoment on the side. React native looked like a great option to start, since i work with react on the web and the learning curve should be faster. I've started with Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller course, and i finished the first section.
