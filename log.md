**Today's Progress**: Started learing React Native, and finished with all the setup.

**Thoughts:** Currently i use React.js for web development and i wanted to learn also mobile develoment on the side. React native looked like a great option to start, since i work with react on the web and the learning curve should be faster. I've started with Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller course, and i finished the first section.

**Today's Progress**: Continued learing React Native, and created the first mobile app.

**Thoughts:** Today i've continued to learn React Native and i've start working on the first simple mobile app. Learning React Native for me till now, seems very easy. This can be happening mostly because till now ive work on React web projects.
